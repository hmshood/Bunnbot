# About BunnBot
BunnBot is a highly customizable chat bot for Picarto.TV. 

BunnBot's primary purpose is to provide access to Picarto.TV's API, and to extend that functionality to additional plugins written by contributors.

BunnBot is designed to function like chat bots commonly seen on other streaming platforms, and is capable of listening for, and reacting to, user commands.

## Plugins

Plugins are scripts which provide BunnBot with additional functionality. Plugins are usually categorized into "Moderation," "Fun," and "Tools." "Moderation" scripts are ones that provide some form of automatic moderation features. "Fun" scripts provide a form of entertainment, and exist purely for the viewers' pleasure. "Tools" are scripts that provide some utility for the streamer, aiding in some way.

BunnBot ships with five official plugins:

* plugins/diceroller - A simple dice rolling script that allows chat members to virtually "roll" a die.
* plugins/filter - A basic, customizable chat filter script that will automatically remove any messages containing blacklisted words.
* plugins/link_whitelist - A customizable link filter, which will remove all links that are not from the whitelisted domains.
* plugins/online_checker - A plugin that allows viewers to check how long the stream has been going, or when the last time it was online.
* plugins/status - A plugin that allows streamers to set their current status (what they're working on, if they're afk, etc), and have it be periodically repeated in chat.

BunnBot also has a built in permissions system, which allows for each plugin to have a set of commands, and an associated set of permissions for each command. Permissions can range from allowing "Everyone" to use the command, to only allowing "Subscribers," to even restricting the command to the "Streamer" only.

### The Cute Clause
Plugin developers are encouraged to developer BunnBot's kind, cute, and helpful personality in its response to user commands! The cuter and fluffier, the better!

# Terms of Use
## 1. Picarto.TV's Terms of Service
Along with the terms outlined in the GPLv3 license provided with this source code, BunnBot cannot be in any way used to replicate or bypass any "Premium" functionality provided by Picarto.TV. This includes (but is not limited to): replicating Picarto.TV's "poll" and "raffle" chat functionality. Creating and/or using plugins that attempt to replicate or bypass Picarto.TV's "Premium" features is a violation of Picarto.TV's Terms of Service, Section 16 ("Hacking/Bypassing"), and is a punishable offense. Furthermore, BunnBot functionality must abide by Section 22 ("User Behavior"), which states that, "chat bots are prohibited to advertise, harass people or post copyright infringing content." 

In order to comply with Picarto.TV Terms of Use Section 16, BunnBot is not allowed to gather "any kind of user information or person related data." BunnBot is also prohibited from providing additional features or permissions to users who have made third-party purchases or donations (transactions occuring outside of Picarto.TV). 

## 2. Plugins
### 2.1 Liability
BunnBot and its original developer (KingCrazy) are not liable for any third-party plugins (plugins which are not shipped with the BunnBot source code) which violate the terms outlined by Picarto.TV, nor are they liable for any actions Picarto.TV take against a user's account brought on by the improper usage of this bot. Any plugins that violate the BunnBot or Picarto.TV terms are to be taken down without question, and any use of illegal plugins is to cease immediately. 

### 2.2 Plugin Licensing
Third-party plugins are not a modification of the source code, and therefore can be created, modified, and distributed under the developer's preferred licensing so long as they abide by the terms outlined in this document. Third-party plugin developers are responsible for upholding and enforcing their own (the third-party plugin developer's) licensing terms. In the event that a third-party plugin violates the terms outlined in this document, Picarto.TV and the original BunnBot developer (KingCrazy) reserve the right to request complete termination and a cease and desist of any plugins that fail to abide by their (Picarto.TV and KingCrazy) respective terms of service.
